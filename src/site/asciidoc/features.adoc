== Features

Tool box with applications to convert SVG graphics to other vector formats and some bitmap formats.

=== Standard Features
Standard features are available in all applications.
They cover configuration for conversion targets, message handling, input file, names for output file(s) and directories, Inkscape layer handling, and other general options.
In addition, the applications are using the ExecS package and thus providing help and version information via command line as well.

==== Help and version
* general help (usage)
* detailed help for each command line options
* version information

==== Input options
* read file either as plain text file or as GZIP (`.gz`) file
* can process plain SVG or Inkscape SVg files (latter required for layers)

==== Target
* set conversion target
* set text-as-shape conversion option

==== Message handling
* set application to quiet mode
* set application to verbose mode
* activate warnings, process information, and detailed messages
* deactivate error messages

==== Output handling
* automatically create directories
* overwrite existing output files
* keep temporarily created artifacts (files and directories)

==== Output name handling
* set output file and/or directory
* set basename for output files
* deactivate use of basename for output files

==== Layer handling
* process Inkscape layers found in input files
* process layers if they exist
* several options for the output file names when using layers
* switch all layers on for single conversion

==== Other features
* simulate conversion, i.e. run but only print messages, do not create any output


=== s2v-fp features
Converts SVG to vector formats using Apache Batik to load an SVG document and the FreeHep libraries for the conversion.
Supported target formats are: EMF, PDF, plain SVG (no Inkscape name space).
Each target allows to configure:

* switch on background
* background color
* switch off transparency


=== s2v-is features
Converts SVG to vector formats and some bitmap formats using an existing Inkscape installation.
Supported target formats are: EMF, PDF, EPS, PS, WMF, plain SVG (no Inkscape name space), and PNG.
Other supported options are:

* set Inkscape executable
* create temporary SVG files first (as plain SVG or as Inkscape SVG)
* manual (for optimized EMF generation) or Inkscape object selection handling of layers
* target specific options as supported by Inkscape:
  ** for PDF: set PDF version
  ** for PS: set PS level
  ** for PNG: set output DPI
