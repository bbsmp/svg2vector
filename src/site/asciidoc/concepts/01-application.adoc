=== Application

The SVG2Vector tool provides different applications to convert SVG graphics to target formats.
The tool uses the SKB ExecS to launch applications.
All applications are registered with the Java class `Svg2VectorExecs` for easy execution.
Once an application is selected for execution, the application specific command line options and processing applies.

Currently supported are:

* `s2v-hp` - converting SVG graphics to vector formats using Apache Batik and Freehep libraries
* `s2v-is` - converting SVG graphics to vector (and selected bitmap) formats using an existing Inkscape executable
