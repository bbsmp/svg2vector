=== Description
In layer mode, any output file will have the Inkscape layer index in the filename.
This index is generated from the field `id`, which in Inkscape starts with the term `layer` followed by an integer.
This integer can but does not have to be continuous (this depends on layers being added, deleted, and moved).


=== Dependency on other CLI options
This option only works in layer mode, so only with `layers`.


=== Interaction with other CLI options
None


=== Supported in Layers
Yes (in layer mode only)
