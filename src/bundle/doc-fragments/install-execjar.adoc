=== Using the executable JAR

* download the executable JAR file from BinTray: https://bintray.com/vdmeer/generic/svg2vector/{release-version}[{release-version}].
* move the JAR to a directory on your system

Now you can run the following command to create scripts executing the applications:

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
java -jar svg2vector-{release-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar gen-exec-jar-scripts
----

This will create scripts, which you can then move into a binary directory of your system.

You can manually run the executable JAR file as well.
The main class of the JAR is set to an ExecS execution service.
Simply running the jar will produce a help screen from ExecS.
Using `-l` shows all registered applications, including `s2v-fh` and `s2v-is`.
Directly running the conversion applications as follows

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
java -jar svg2vector-{release-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar s2v-fh
----

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
java -jar svg2vector-{release-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar s2v-is
----
