=== Build and install from source
One can also clone the repository, build it, and then use the created application artifacts.
Clone and build the repository from Github:

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://github.com/vdmeer/svg2vector.git
cd svg2vector
mvn package
----

This will create a folder target with all build artifacts.
In the target folder, one can find application artifacts to run the tool.

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
cd target/application
ls -l
----

The artifacts there are (substitute X/Y/Z with the version you cloned/built)

* svg2vector-{release-version}-application.tar.gz
* svg2vector-{release-version}-application.zip
* svg2vector-{release-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Now use either of the two archives and install the stand-alone application or the executable JAR.
