=== In Java

The applications can be used in Java by simply creating a `String[]` with the commands (same as command line) and then calling the execution method `executeApplication(...)` directly.
The following code shows an example creating and object for the `s2v-fh` application, with a set of command line options, and then executing it.

[source, java, linenums]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String[] args = new String[]{
	"--create-directories", "--overwrite-existing",
	"--all-layers", "-l", "-i",
	"-t", "pdf",
	"-f", "src/test/resources/svg-files/time-interval-based.svgz",
	"-d", "target/output-tests/s2v-fh/pdf/layers-index",
	"-q"
};
Svg2Vector_FH app = new Svg2Vector_FH();
app.executeApplication(args);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The applications use return codes to provide information about the execution status:

* `0` means successful execution
* `>0` means an early exit option (such as `--help` or `--version`) was used
* `<0` means an error did occur
