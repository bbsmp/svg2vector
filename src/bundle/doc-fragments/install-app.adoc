=== As a stand-alone application
The stand-alone application can be installed in UNIX and CygWin systems.
The installation will create all required scripts to run the applications
On CygWin, the installation will also create DOS/Windows batch files to start the applications.

* download the ZIP archive from BinTray: https://bintray.com/vdmeer/generic/svg2vector/{release-version}[{release-version}].
* unzip in a directory of your choice

Now you can run the script generation:
----
cd bin
./init.sh
----

The script `init.sh` will create scripts to run the tool for Unix (`bin/sh`) and if you run `init.sh` on a CygWin system also for CygWin (`bin/cyg`) and DOS/Windows (`bin/bat`).
Now simple run the script `sh/s2v-hp.sh` (assuming you are on a Unix system).
