=== v2.0.0 - major rewrite, changed CLI behavior - 2017-04-13
* added appliction base and properties
  ** some 22 CLI options are now supported by all applications, all processed by application base or properties
  ** with full test cases for all behaviors
* added loaders and moved old functions to `BatikLoader`
* added CLI options for application base
  ** `use-basename` for using a different base name for output files when processing layers
  ** `all-layers` to switch on all layers prior to conversion (no layer mode)
  ** `simulate` to simulate a conversion without creating any output artifacts
  ** `overwrite-existing` to overwrite existing output files
  ** `no-errors` to switch off error messages
  ** `print-warnings` to switch on warning messages
  ** `print-progress` to switch on progress messages
  ** `print-details` to switch on detailed messages
  ** `one-per-layer` new option to generate one output file per layer (if input file has layers)
  ** `target` changed to provide additional functionality
  ** `layers-if-exist` to process layers if input file has layers
  ** `keep-tmp-artifacts` keep temporarily created artifacts (files and directories)
  ** `fout-no-basename` to not use base name for outout file when processing layers
  ** `create-directories` to create all required directories for output files
* application behavior changes
  ** much more errors being catched before conversion starts
  ** warning bein catched before conversion starts
  ** application can run in simulation mode w/o generating any output
  ** required directories can be created automatically by the application
  ** existing output files will not be overwritten unless requested
* CLI behavior for layers with file name containing index and identifier changed
  ** simple `-I` will use ID only
  ** simple `-i` will use index only
  ** `-I` and `-i` will use both
* changed messaging behavior
  ** can be set quiet or verbose or switched on seperately (warnings, progress, details)
  ** errors are on by default, can be switched off via CLI `no-errors`
* switched to Batik v1.6-1 (and cleaned dependencies)
* added `s2v-is`
  ** convert SVG files using an existing Inkscape installation
  ** supported targets: pdf, png, emf, wmf, svg, eps, ps
  ** some targets with specific CLI options
  ** can process layers manually, sort of brute force, over lines of an SVG document w/o W3C DOM (required to process EMFs correctly)
  ** can create temporary files/directories being removed when finished (unless requested to be kept)
* changed main class in jar-with-dependencies to Svg2VectorExecs
  ** also removed the Tool class, no longer needed
  ** added s2v-is to the ExecS class
* changed s2v-hp implementation, refactoring all classes and removing uneccessary methods
* changed all documentation to use asciidoc
* changed test class behavior
  ** `s2v-fh` test classes now create files in `target` directory
  ** `s2v-is` test clases run in simulation mode with a fake Inkscape executable
* changed SVG test files
  ** removed old score cards
  ** added an Inkscape layer test file `rina-ipc`
  ** added a basic simple SVG file `simple`
* using new `ExecS` version (0.4.0) now with application to create start scripts for executable jars
* added documentation in `site` content duplicated in API docs and README
* provided solution for EMF and PDF conversion problems, especially with Inkscape SVGs
  ** instead of using Batik/Freehep from `s2v-fh` use `s2v-is` with existing Inkscape installation
  ** other options are not available as of today
* open issues
  ** add standard `s2v-fh` options to `s2v-is`, e.g. background and transparancy
