=== v2.1.0 - refactor, change in CLI - 2017-##-##
* internal refactoring of application base
  ** grouped options and separated them in packages
  ** changed option initialization and testing behavior
  ** simplified standard behavior for input, layer, and output options
  ** added object to manage temporary artifacts
     *** a temporary directory will now always be created, and all tmp artifacts written into it
  ** added test cases
* added CLI for printing stack trace
* changed FOUT CLI options for processing layers:
  ** option `i` changes
     *** long option now `fout-index` (was `fout-layer-index`)
     *** effect now: use a continuous index starting with 1 for naming files
  ** option `I` changes
     *** long option now `fout-isindex` (was `fout-layer-id`)
     *** effect now: use an index generated from the Inkscape object id for naming files
  ** new option `B` with long option `fout-islabel`
     *** effect: use the Inkscape label string to name files
     *** was `I` in the old CLI
* added error codes and error code categories
* added application `s2v-aec` printing all known error codes to standard out
* changed the whole option process to use exceptions
  ** standard runtime exceptions are not mentioned anymore in JavaDoc, arguments are described with "must" and "should" to indicate them (all must/should are runtime tested
  ** added S2VException for exceptions that use a defined error code and message
  ** changed the applications to catch exceptions and stop processing (old behavior was to return early)


=== v2.0.0 - major rewrite, changed CLI behavior - 2017-04-13
* added appliction base and properties
  ** some 22 CLI options are now supported by all applications, all processed by application base or properties
  ** with full test cases for all behaviors
* added loaders and moved old functions to `BatikLoader`
* added CLI options for application base
  ** `use-basename` for using a different base name for output files when processing layers
  ** `all-layers` to switch on all layers prior to conversion (no layer mode)
  ** `simulate` to simulate a conversion without creating any output artifacts
  ** `overwrite-existing` to overwrite existing output files
  ** `no-errors` to switch off error messages
  ** `print-warnings` to switch on warning messages
  ** `print-progress` to switch on progress messages
  ** `print-details` to switch on detailed messages
  ** `one-per-layer` new option to generate one output file per layer (if input file has layers)
  ** `target` changed to provide additional functionality
  ** `layers-if-exist` to process layers if input file has layers
  ** `keep-tmp-artifacts` keep temporarily created artifacts (files and directories)
  ** `fout-no-basename` to not use base name for outout file when processing layers
  ** `create-directories` to create all required directories for output files
* application behavior changes
  ** much more errors being catched before conversion starts
  ** warning bein catched before conversion starts
  ** application can run in simulation mode w/o generating any output
  ** required directories can be created automatically by the application
  ** existing output files will not be overwritten unless requested
* CLI behavior for layers with file name containing index and identifier changed
  ** simple `-I` will use ID only
  ** simple `-i` will use index only
  ** `-I` and `-i` will use both
* changed messaging behavior
  ** can be set quiet or verbose or switched on seperately (warnings, progress, details)
  ** errors are on by default, can be switched off via CLI `no-errors`
* switched to Batik v1.6-1 (and cleaned dependencies)
* added `s2v-is`
  ** convert SVG files using an existing Inkscape installation
  ** supported targets: pdf, png, emf, wmf, svg, eps, ps
  ** some targets with specific CLI options
  ** can process layers manually, sort of brute force, over lines of an SVG document w/o W3C DOM (required to process EMFs correctly)
  ** can create temporary files/directories being removed when finished (unless requested to be kept)
* changed main class in jar-with-dependencies to Svg2VectorExecs
  ** also removed the Tool class, no longer needed
  ** added s2v-is to the ExecS class
* changed s2v-hp implementation, refactoring all classes and removing uneccessary methods
* changed all documentation to use asciidoc
* changed test class behavior
  ** `s2v-fh` test classes now create files in `target` directory
  ** `s2v-is` test clases run in simulation mode with a fake Inkscape executable
* changed SVG test files
  ** removed old score cards
  ** added an Inkscape layer test file `rina-ipc`
  ** added a basic simple SVG file `simple`
* using new `ExecS` version (0.4.0) now with application to create start scripts for executable jars
* added documentation in `site` content duplicated in API docs and README
* provided solution for EMF and PDF conversion problems, especially with Inkscape SVGs
  ** instead of using Batik/Freehep from `s2v-fh` use `s2v-is` with existing Inkscape installation
  ** other options are not available as of today


=== v1.1.0 - feature add - 2017-04-05
* removed old CLI implementation, added ExecS as executor
* added assembly plugin to create an application archive using ExecS script generation
* fixed problems in the tests as per issue #3 (output now in target not src)
* added applications for FreeHep and Inkscape converters
* changed Tool to directly execute the FreeHep application


=== v1.0.3 - feature add - 2016-03-03

* fixed old dependency problem


=== v1.0.2 - feature add - 2015-06-18
* updated for FreeHep 2.4 release

* started separate GIT repo for the tool


=== v1.0.1 - minor changes - 2014-06-25
* changed PDF margins to proper FreeHep handling `properties.setProperty(PDFGraphics2D.PAGE_MARGINS, "0, 0, 0, 0");` in `PdfProperties`


=== v1.0.0 - initial release - 2014-06-10
* still requires a patch to PDF graphics for custom page size for PDF images: https://github.com/freehep/freehep-vectorgraphics/pull/25/files
