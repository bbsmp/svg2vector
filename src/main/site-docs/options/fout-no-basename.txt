In layer mode, this option will prevent output filenames from using a basename (either a requested one or the basename of the input file).
To allow for non-abigious file names, one or more of the following options needs to be used as well: `fout-index`, `fout-isindex`, or `fout-islabel`.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

This option only works in layer mode, so only with `layers`.

Without a basename, filenames for output files will be ambigious or all layer files will have the same output filename.
Thus one or more of the `fout` options needs to be used as well: `fout-index`, `fout-isindex`, and `fout-islabel`.

=== Interaction with other CLI options

If used, `use-basename` will have no effect.

=== Supported in Layers

Yes (in layer mode only)
