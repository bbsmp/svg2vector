This option switches on layer mode.
In this mode, an application will attempt to create one output file per layer found in the SVG documents.
By layers we mean Inkscape layers, which are essentially special groups (elements with a key `inkscape:groupmode` set to `"layer"`).
Other layers are not supported.

When used, the SVG document will be scanned for layers.
If no layers are defined, an error will be created and the application terminates.
If you want to process documents that might (but not necessarily will) contain layers, then use the option `layers-if-exist` instead.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

None

=== Interaction with other CLI options

This option switches on the layer mode, so it effects all other options that either require layer mode or have a specific behavior in layer mode.

=== Supported in Layers

Yes
