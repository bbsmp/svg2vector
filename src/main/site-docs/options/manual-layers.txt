This option will activate manual Inkscape layer handling when in layer mode and when temporary SVG artifacts are produced.
Manual layer management means that the Inkscape SVG document is manipulated line-by-line in memory rather than using any existing SVG or XML library or Inkscape directly.

If not used in the command line, layer management will be done by Inkscape using the Inkscape CLI options `-j` to export a specific identifier, `-i` to name the identifier, and `--select` for identifier selection.
Inkscape will perform as expected for targets such as `pdf`, `png`, and `ps`.
However, for the target `emf` the export area (clipping) will not be the page but the actual objects in the layer.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

This option has an effect only when in layer mode and when `svg-first` is activated.
Layer mode requires `layers` or `layers-if-exist` and an Inkscape SVG document with layers.

=== Interaction with other CLI options

If the `target` is set to `emf`, this option is currently the only way within the given applications to correctly transform Inkscape name spaces to an EMF graphic.

=== Supported in Layers

Yes
