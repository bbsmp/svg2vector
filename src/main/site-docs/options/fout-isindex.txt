In layer mode, any output file will have the Inkscape layer index in the filename.
This index is generated from the field `id`, which in Inkscape starts with the term `layer` followed by an integer.
This integer can but does not have to be continuous (this depends on layers being added, deleted, and moved).

=== Dependency on other CLI options

This option only works in layer mode, so only with `layers`.

=== Interaction with other CLI options

None

=== Supported in Layers

Yes (in layer mode only)
