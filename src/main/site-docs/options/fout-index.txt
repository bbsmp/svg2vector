Each output file (n layer mode) will have a continuous index in the filename.
This index is generated from the position of the definition of the layer in the SVG document.
The first layer defined has index 1, the second has index2, and so forth.

In the filename, the index will be shown using the string format `%02d`.
An index `1` will result in `01`, index `2` will result in `02`, and so forth.
The option supports up to 99 layers.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

This option only works in layer mode, so only with `layers`.

=== Interaction with other CLI options
