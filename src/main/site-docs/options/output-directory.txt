This option sets the output directory.
The argument may contain a path using the system's path separator or '/'.
Every element in the path will be treated as a directory, even if the pattern is that of a filename.
For instance, in an output directory `mydir/foo/bla.pdf` the last path element `bla.pdf` is treated as a directory.

The default value in layer mode is the current directory.
In no layer mode, the option has no default value.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

=== Interaction with other CLI options

If not in layer mode, this option will change the output directory while the filename is generated from either `output-file` or `input-file`.

=== Supported in Layers

Yes, in layer mode the option is used to specify the output directory.
