In layer mode, this color will be used for all layers.

The implementation uses the Java AWT class `Color`.
To set a color, the method `Color.getColor(String)` is used.
This means that the value of this option is treated as a system property, which is then being read to retrieve the background color value.
This value should be an integer.
