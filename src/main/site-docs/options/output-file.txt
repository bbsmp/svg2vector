This option sets the output filename.
The argument may contain a path using the system's path separator or '/'.
The option is only used when no layers are processed, otherwise it will be ignored.

The filename (i.e. all path elements removed) may contain any character that the underlying operating system supports.
It can also contain dots `.`.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

The default value, when the option is not used in the command line, is the directory and basename of the input file name plus the file extension for the required target.
For instance, if the input file name is `mydir/foo/bla.svg` the output filename for a `pdf` target will be `mydir/foo/bla.pdf`.

=== Interaction with  other CLI options

The output directory can be changed using the option `output-directory`.

=== Supported in Layers

No, the option is not used when layers are processed.
A warning will be created instead and the option will be ignored.
