This option activates the printing of stack traces in case an exception is caught during the execution of an application.
The option has only an effect if error messages are activated.

An application will not print the full stack trace but limit any output to packages containing either `vandermeer` or `apache`.
Exceptions caused by Apache classes are usually validation errors.
Many methods validate input parameters for instance for not being `null` or lists and arrays for not containing null elements.
Exceptions caused by classes from `vandermeer` packages will be either validation errors, or processing errors.

=== Dependency on other CLI options
