This option sets the resolution for a bitmap export, here for the target `png`.
It can also be used for fallback rasterization of filtered objects when exporting to `ps`, `eps`, or `pdf`.
There is no default value of the CLI option.
However, Inkscape uses a DPI of 96 as default, which corresponds to 1 SVG user unit (px, also called "user unit") exporting to 1 bitmap pixel.

=== Dependency on other CLI options

This option only has an effect when the target is set to `png`, `ps`, `eps`, or `pdf`.
