This option sets the Inkscape executable.
The option will process default values as follows:
First, the environment variable `INKSCAPE` is tested.
If it is not null, its value is set as default.
Next, if the operating system is a Windows system (using Apache Commons `SystemUtils`), the default value is set to `C:/Program Files/Inkscape/inkscape.exe`.
Next, if the operating system is a UNIX system (using Apache Commons `SystemUtils`), the default value is set to `/usr/bin/inkscape`.
In all other cases, no default value will be set.
Using the option in the command line will use the given executable and ignore any default settings.

When executing Inkscape, some standard Inkscape CLI options will be used.
To avoid starting the GUI, `--without-gui` is used.
To export all graphics using the page are as clipping, the option `--export-area-page` is used.
All other Inkscape CLI options will be generated from the application CLI options.
